Here at [eklaweb](http://www.eklaweb.com) we like to take up technical challenges. This blog will be the
place where our engineers will publish articles about the most interesting
ones.

We'll be talking mainly about Scala, functionnal programming, HTML5 mobile
development with or without Phonegap / Cordova and JS-intensive web
applications.
